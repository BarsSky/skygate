# Skygate release notes

## Where to look for releases

**This file is an index. The authoritative source for any release is
the git tag.** Browse releases:

```sh
git tag --list                      # all tags
git show v0.26.0                    # full diff + message for v0.26.0
git log --oneline v0.25.0..v0.26.0  # commits between two tags
```

The GitHub Releases view mirrors the tags and adds a UI:
https://github.com/BarsSky/skygate/releases

`CHANGELOG.md` is the human-curated summary of what's in main
at any moment, organized by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
format. Older `RELEASE-NOTES-v0.X.Y.md` files (deleted in 2026-07-24
as part of the v0.27.0 repo cleanup) had the same content as the
commit messages + the eventual GitHub release notes — nothing was
lost; everything is still in `git log` + the GitHub UI.

## v0.28.7 — Per-DEVICE ACL grants for tagged devices (Moonlight fix)

The v0.28.0 per-device ACL design tagged every device with
`tag:dev-<user>-<device>`. The per-user grant `src=user@` was supposed
to cover tagged devices too, but in Tailscale v2 policy the per-user
identity doesn't match tagged devices — only the tag does. Result:
skybars (Android, `tag:dev-skyadmin-skybars`) couldn't reach skyworker
(Windows, `tag:dev-skyadmin-skyworker`) over Tailscale for Moonlight,
even though both devices belonged to the same portal user.

### What changed

v0.29.0 adds a **per-DEVICE grant block** to the generated policy:
for each portal user with N≥2 devices, emit N grants (one per
device as `src`), with `dst` = the list of all OTHER devices of
the same user, and `ip: ["*"]` (required by headscale 0.29.2).
13 grants on this VM (11 skyadmin + 2 michail); O(n) per user,
not O(n²).

The earlier v0.28.7 attempt (commit `8749069`) tried a wildcard
`tag:dev-<user>-*` src, which headscale 0.29.2 rejects with
"src=tag not found" (the parser requires concrete tags in
`tagOwners{}`).

### Why this works

Tailscale ACL is order-sensitive (first match wins). The per-DEVICE
grant is emitted **after** the per-user grant (which keeps SSH
+ untagged identities working) and **before** per-device exit-rules
+ per-device loose grants (autogroup:internet). Tagged-to-tagged
device traffic on the same tailnet now matches the per-DEVICE
grant as a fallback when no specific per-device rule applies.

### Code shape

The per-DEVICE block is duplicated in `GenerateACLForPlane` and
`GenerateACLWithViaForPlane` (the v0.28.1 per-user via variant
takes a parallel code path). v0.30.0 will extract the block to a
shared helper — the duplication is documented in the AGENTS.md
release notes for v0.28.7 as a known cleanup target.

### Verification

- Live: 13 new per-DEVICE grants in the headscale policy after
  `/admin/exit-rules/reapply` (HTTP 303 redirect)
- Operator confirmation: skybars ↔ skyworker Moonlight session
  now establishes and streams (2026-07-27)
- `make verify-pre` 9/9 PASS, `make verify-post` 25/26 PASS
  (R9 is a known false-negative — the verify-post script reads
  an older `acl_snapshots` row; the most recent reapply did
  succeed and saved a fresh snapshot)

## How a release is cut

1. `git tag -a v0.X.Y -m "v0.X.Y"` on the commit we want to ship.
2. `git push origin v0.X.Y`.
3. (Operator-driven) create a GitHub release at
   https://github.com/BarsSky/skygate/releases/new — the body
   summarizes the commits since the previous tag.
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` to move the entry from `[Unreleased]`
   into the new tagged section.

The operator (skyadmin) writes the release body; the git tag is
the source of truth for "what shipped in v0.X.Y".
